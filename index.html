            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I volunteered at Mark’s adventure daycare as part of my serving learning experience. Mark’s Adventure is a home daycare that provides a supportive and friendly environment for children to learn and develop vital social, emotional, and behavioral skills and reach their developmental milestones.</p>
            <p>I engaged with children through play, songs, and storytelling. I prepared teaching materials, ensured the facility was clean and safe, supervised the children’s activities, and collaborated with other instructors to facilitate a safe and healthy environment. I reported to the home daycare for five days and spent two hours per day interacting with children and their instructors.</p>
            <p>I chose to volunteer at the daycare since it allowed me to interact with children between two and five years and observe their emotional, social, physical, and cognitive development. Mark’s Adventure offers an environment that advances inquisitiveness and curiosity through play-based and project-based activities. Hence, by working in the daycare, I got to observe and appreciate the importance of play in social development during this age.</p>

        <section id="reflections">
            <h2>Reflections</h2>
            <h3>Growth and Learning</h3>
            <p>Volunteering at the daycare offered an excellent opportunity to transfer the theoretical knowledge gained from class into practice. I particularly got to experience and apply Piaget’s theory of cognitive development and Vygotsky’s social development theory during the service-learning activity.</p>
            <p>Piaget would classify the children I interacted with under the preoperative stage. In this stage, children begin to think symbolically and learn to use pictures and words to represent objects. They have improved their thinking and language but still think in concrete terms. For example, they associate voices with certain people and sounds with toys. Kids in this stage learn through pretend play. Play is vital in providing a caring and safe environment where children can use exploratory processes to recreate their experiences. Pretend play helps them express their fears, thoughts, and anxiety. I used this information to structure learning material. We used playdough and toys, created Halloween art, and drew and colored different pictures. I also engaged them in group activities such as storytelling, plays, and singing to improve their social skills.</p>
            <p>According to Erikson’s Stages of Psychosocial Development, children enter the initiative vs. guilt stage from age three. They are inquisitive and use their imagination to understand the world around them. My role was to support this stage by answering the children’s questions, reinforcing their attempts at autonomy with praise and rewards, and guiding them in making moral choices or differentiating right from wrong.</p>
            <p>Through engaging with preschool-aged children, I observed and identified the development of gender identity and gender roles among them. The sense of male or female is a vital dimension of the self. Children in this age group become increasingly interested in identifying the physical differences between boys and girls and what activities are acceptable for each gender. For instance, some children claim they cannot play with Barbie dolls because they are not girls. However, they knew that playing with Barbies could not change their gender. My supervisor commended me for my ability to engage with the children and guide them in their social and cognitive development.</p>
            <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
            <p>Like most learning experiences, this one was not without its challenges. For instance, considering this was my first time working in a daycare, I experienced difficulties handling a group of children with diverging experiences and forming rapport with them.</p>
            <p>One major instance is when I had trouble engaging one child who would isolate and withdraw from his peers because of his ambivalent attachment style. He would express severe distress after his mother left and was wary of his instructors. It was hard to console him or get him involved in classroom activities. I sought the help of an instructor who taught me to be patient with the child. Rather than push him to join the others, I would let him play alone and motivate him to join the rest through encouragement and rewards. I assured him the class was safe, and his classmates would love it if he joined us. I would then reward him with praise for every attempt to join the group. I also set a meeting with his parent to discuss their parenting styles and relationship with the child and how they influenced his behavior. I believe that being disciplined, respectful, proactive, and interested in collaborating with the other instructors helped me manage these challenges. </p>
            <p>The service-learning activity helped me experience significant professional and personal growth. For instance, interacting with children, their instructors, and their parents helped me develop empathy, compassion, and care. I also developed problem-solving and critical thinking skills that are integral to my profession.</p>
            <h3>Daily Activities and Impact</h3>
            <p>Throughout my service, I engaged in various creative activities with the children, including:</p>
